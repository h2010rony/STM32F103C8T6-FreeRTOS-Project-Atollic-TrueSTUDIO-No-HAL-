# STM32F103C8T6-FreeRTOS-Project-Atollic-TrueSTUDIO-No-HAL-
This repository contains a minimal and clean FreeRTOS project for the STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill) board, built entirely in Atollic TrueSTUDIO without using STM32CubeMX or the STM32 HAL library. The project is designed for developers who prefer bare-metal control, lightweight code, and a fully manual project structure.
